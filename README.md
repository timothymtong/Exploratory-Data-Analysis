# Marketing Data Analysis

This dataset was provided to students for their final projects in a course called Advanced Data Analytics as part of the Master of Science Business Analytics program at Hult International Business School for the AY 20/21.  It is from a food/beverage company including customer profiles, product preferences, campaign success measurement, and sales channel performance.  This is my final project after completing Codecademy's Data Analyst Path, where I am able to showcase some of the data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization techniques I've learned using Python.
